                   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) grants every musician the legal right to perform so you can find many of them inside subway stations.  In 2020, music in the subway disappeared because of the city lockdown. The MTA restarted its Music Under New York program, which organize some 350 performers at some of the most popular underground spots. It gives people the feeling that New York is returning to normal. Performance in the subway represents the street culture of New York City.
